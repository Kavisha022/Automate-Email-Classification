# ðŸ“§ Automated Email Classification and Routing System
This project automates the classification of incoming emails into predefined insurance categories (e.g., Automobile, Medical, Housing) using BERT and SVM models. It also sends automated acknowledgment responses to customers and routes categorized emails to the relevant department.

## ðŸ”§ Features
âœ… Email Fetching from inbox using IMAP

âœ… Text Cleaning for subject & body

âœ… Email Parsing with mailparser

âœ… BERT-based Classification using Hugging Face Transformers

âœ… SVM-based Backup Classifier using TF-IDF

âœ… Confusion Matrix Evaluation

âœ… Automatic Acknowledgment Email

âœ… Departmental Email Routing

âœ… Excel Logging of processed emails

âœ… Avoids Resending using Log Tracking

## ðŸ§  Model Training (BERT)
Tokenizes using BERT

Fine-tunes bert-base-uncased on your email data

Saves model and tokenizer to local folders

You can also optionally use an SVM classifier (svm_classifier.py) for fast training and baseline comparison.

## ðŸ“¥ Fetching and Logging Emails
Extracts sender, subject, and body

Saves emails to emails.xlsx

## ðŸ“¬ Sending Acknowledgment Emails
python acknowledgment_sender.py

## ðŸ“¤ Forward Classified Emails to Departments
python classify_and_forward.py
Loads the BERT model

Classifies emails from Excel

Sends them to department email addresses

Uses sent_log.txt to prevent duplicates

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation
After training, train_classifier.py displays a confusion matrix and prints validation accuracy.
